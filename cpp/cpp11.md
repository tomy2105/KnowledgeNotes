# CPP 11

## Extensions to the C++ core language

### Rvalue references
A new non-const reference type called an rvalue reference, identified by `T&&` is added. This refers to temporaries that are permitted to be modified after they are initialized, for the purpose of allowing "move semantics" (solving a performance problem with costly and unneeded deep copies if an temporary is created or returned from a function, neglecting [return value optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_value_optimization "Return value optimization")).

For safety reasons, some restrictions are imposed. A named variable will never be considered to be an rvalue even if it is declared as such. To get an rvalue, the function template [`std::move()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/move) should be used. Rvalue references can also be modified only under certain circumstances, being intended to be used primarily with move constructors.

More info about various value categories (including newer C++ standard ones) can be found [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/value_category) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/rvalue-reference-declarator-amp-amp?view=vs-2019).

### Move constructors

A move constructor of class `T` is a non-template constructor whose first parameter is T&& (can be const and/or volatile) and the rest of the parameters, if present, have default values.

``class_name ( [const and/or volatile] class_name&& other)``

Although argument can be const per specification it is seldom so, because it "interferes" with "stealing" the resource from it.

Typically called when an object is initialized temporary of the same type, including:

-   initialization: 
``T b; T a = std::move(b); T a(std::move(b));
``
-   function argument passing: 
``f(T arg) {}; T a; f(std::move(a));
``
-   function return: 
``T a; return a; 
``

It is is often optimized out or never made, see [copy elision](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision).

Typically "steals" the resources held by the argument rather than make copies of them, and leave the argument in some valid but otherwise indeterminate state (which can be specified by specific implementation). 

More info can be found [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/move_constructor).

### Move assignment

``class_name& class_name::operator= ( [const and/or volatile] class_name&& other)``

Identical in usage and restrictions to move constructor (apart from need to protect from self-assignment).

More info can be found [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/move_assignment).

Sample code with move assignment and move constructor can be found in [Move.cpp](Move.cpp)

### Generalized constant expressions

Keyword `constexpr` is introduced specifying that a function or object constructor is a compile-time constant.

`constexpr int get_five() {return 5;}`

`int some_value[get_five() + 7]; // Create an array of 12 integers. Invalid without constexpr above.`

- function must have a non-void return type
- cannot declare variables or define new types
- may contain only declarations, null statements and a single return statement
- return statement produces a constant expression (after argument substitution)

In addition constant expressions need not be of integral or enumeration type anymore.

`constexpr double earth_gravitational_acceleration = 9.8;`
`constexpr double moon_gravitational_acceleration = earth_gravitational_acceleration / 6.0;`

### Modification to the definition of plain old data

POD concept devided into two separate concepts: _trivial_ (statically initializiable and `memcpy`able) and _standard-layout_ (compatible with C, member ordering and packing).

A _trivial_ class or struct is defined as one that has trivial constructors (default, copy and move), trivial copy and move assignment operator and trivial and non virtual destructor. 

A class or struct is _standard-layout_ if it has no virtual functions or base classes, all members have same acess, and some other rules that can be seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11#Modification_to_the_definition_of_plain_old_data).

`extern template class std::vector<MyClass>;`

Compiler _will not_ instantiate the template in current translation unit (build time reduced).
