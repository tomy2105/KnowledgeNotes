# CPP 11

## Extensions to the C++ core language

### Rvalue references
A new non-const reference type called an rvalue reference, identified by `T&&` is added. This refers to temporaries that are permitted to be modified after they are initialized, for the purpose of allowing "move semantics" (solving a performance problem with costly and unneeded deep copies if an temporary is created or returned from a function, neglecting [return value optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_value_optimization "Return value optimization")).

For safety reasons, some restrictions are imposed. A named variable will never be considered to be an rvalue even if it is declared as such. To get an rvalue, the function template `std::move()` should be used. Rvalue references can also be modified only under certain circumstances, being intended to be used primarily with move constructors.

### Move constructors

A move constructor of class `T` is a non-template constructor whose first parameter is T&& (can be const and/or volatile) and the rest of the parameters, if present, have default values.

``class_name ( [const and/or volatile] class_name&& other)``
